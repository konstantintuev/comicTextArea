# Internationalize web comics with Javascript #

## What? ##

My project tries to solve a problem with many web comics - there needs to be separate images for every language in which the comic is translated.

This makes it hard for many translations to be available, wastes time for the creators and makes community sourced translations a lot harder.

## How is this project going? ##

It's still a javascript only editor and preview. The editor is not very well optimized for mobile.
